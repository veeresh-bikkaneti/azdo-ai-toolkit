## 🔒 Security & Privacy Core

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This extension operates 100% LOCALLY.**

*   **No Network Calls**: Use of `fetch`, `http`, or remote telemetry is strictly prohibited and disabled.
*   **Local Logging**: All actions are logged deeply and transparently to a local Markdown file: `AI_Initiative_Activity_Log.md` in your workspace root.
*   **Data Privacy**: No data is ever uploaded or shared. You own your logs and your data.

## Features

*   **One-Click Scaffolding**: Deploys the full `AI_Initiative_Docs` suite to your project.
*   **Auto-Sanitization**: Automatically replaces placeholders with your local project details.
*   **Transparent Audit**: Verifiable local activity log.

2.  Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
